<h1>Force Completed</h1>

<p>Force completed will ensure that the status of the current attempt is forced to "completed" if cmi.core.score.raw has been issued, and as such is only relevant for SCORM 1.2 packages. </p>
<p>This is usefull if the SCORM package does not handle revisiting an attempt correctly, in review or browse mode, or otherwise incorrectly issues the completion status.</p>
